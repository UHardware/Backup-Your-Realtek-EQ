# Backup and Restore Your Realtek EQ profile - the easiet way!
Realtek has in its driver the ability to configure your own EQ profile for Audio equipment. Unfortunately, there is no official way to save the profile to a file or transfer it to another computer. <br>
<br>
In this guide, I'll show you how to protect and restore your audio settings on any device with a Realtek sound card.

## Step 1 - Save Your profile
<h3 align="left">To make a copy of your settings, you will need to use the Windows registry</h3> 

  1. WIN + R
  2. Type "regedit" and hit Enter
  3. Confirm that you run the application with administrator privileges

<h3 align="left">Done! Your EQ audio settings are now safe :)</h3> 

## Step 2 - Restoring Your profile (any device)
<h4 align="left">Again, as in the case of saving a profile, we will also use Regedit to restore the settings.</h4> 

  1. At the beginning, a good step would be to manually create any EQ profile for the device we are interested in. For example, "example123" <br>

After creating the profile, we need to close ALL audio settings <br>
  <br>
  2. Open your *.reg copy file with notepad and search for the name of the profile you want to restore. In my case, the profile was called "darek10"

  * confirm that you run the application with administrator privileges <br>
  CTRL + F, type profile name <br>

  3. Copy ONLY the second line of the configuration. It contains the HEX value. <br>
  Create a new text document according to the template below:

  <br>
  
  Template: <br>

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\MMDevices\Audio\Render\{XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX}\FxProperties]
"{YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY},Z"=hex:41,00,b6,99,01,00,00,00,85,00,\
  00,00,e9,00,00,00,85,00,00,00,91,fe,ff,ff,9c,ff,ff,ff,a7,00,00,00,0b,01,00,\
  00,85,00,00,00,15,02,00,00,20,03,00,00
```
<br>
Note: The HEX Code given in this template is my own configuration for Klipsch R51-M + Loxjie A30. You will need to paste your own HEX Code from your backup!
<br>

  4. Now open regedit and search EACH directory ".../Render/xxxxxxxxxxx/FxProperties" for a file containing the name of the previously created example profile "example123"

  5. Find the matching REG_BINARY configuration file and copy |X Y Z|
  Paste |X Y Z| in the appropriate places according to the instructions from the previous pictures.
